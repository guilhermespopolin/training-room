This is a solution to the [Advice Generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db/hub/advice-generator-app-5DJeC7ZO9P).
It consists on a very simple app that requests random advices from an [API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and display them. Even though very simple, the idea was to getting to know
[Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Tailwincss](https://tailwindcss.com/) frameworks.
